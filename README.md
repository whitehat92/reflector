With this project, my intention was to play around with the parameters and values within an url.
It basically detects the parameters (until 2) present in the url, then replaces them with the scripts from a second argument

-->You should call the script like:
$ python3 reflector.py https://example.com/index.php?id=43&nf=true <path_to_payloads>
